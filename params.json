  "body": "# Main features\r\n  * Framework in place to execute JS on the site from the app and call functions in the app from within the website\r\n  * Elegant loading screen, with animated logo, fading in and out as pages load\r\n  * Swipe to the right for BACK and to the left for FORWARD\r\n  * Works in all orientations thanks to auto-constraints + the website being nicely mobile compatible\r\n\r\n# How to use\r\nSimply change the URL in ViewController.swift and update the icons and logos in the Assets manager. For more complex behaviour, take a quick look at Test/index.html and at the code in the ViewController to quickly setup JS communication between the app and the website and send anything from Geolocation data to user input.\r\n\r\n# Small test\r\n  To test the JS callbacks between the app and a site, the Test/index.html file can be uploaded to a host and accessed.\r\n\r\n# TO DO\r\n  Nice handling of offline scenarious - e.g. show an UIAlert with a retry button.\r\n",
